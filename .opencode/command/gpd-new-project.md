<!-- Tool names and @ includes are platform-specific. The installer translates paths for your runtime. -->
<!-- Allowed-tools are runtime-specific. Other platforms may use different tool interfaces. -->

<context>
**Flags:**
- `--auto` — Automatic mode. Synthesizes a scoping contract from the supplied document, asks for one explicit scope approval, then runs research → requirements → roadmap with minimal follow-up interaction. Expects a research proposal document via @ reference.
- `--minimal` — Fast bootstrapping mode. Uses one structured intake plus one scoping approval gate, then creates all `.gpd/` artifacts with lean content. Scope, anchors, and decisive outputs are still required.
- `--minimal @file.md` — Create project directly from a markdown file describing your research and phases. Parses research question, phases, and key parameters from the file.
</context>

<objective>
Initialize a new physics research project through unified flow: questioning or structured intake → scoping contract approval → literature survey (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

If no project config exists yet, the workflow opens with the physics-questioning pass, then asks for workflow preferences only after scope approval and before the first project-artifact commit.

**Creates:**

- `.gpd/PROJECT.md` — research project context
- `.gpd/config.json` — workflow preferences
- `.gpd/research/` — domain and literature research (optional)
- `.gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped research requirements
- `.gpd/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure
- `.gpd/STATE.md` — project memory
- `.gpd/state.json` `project_contract` — authoritative machine-readable scoping contract

**After this command:** Run `/gpd-plan-phase 1` to start execution.
</objective>

<execution_context>

<!-- [included: new-project.md] -->
<purpose>
Initialize a new physics research project through unified flow: questioning, literature survey (optional), mathematical framework, computational setup, target venue identification. This is the most leveraged moment in any research project — deep questioning here means better formulations, better methods, better results. One workflow takes you from research idea to ready-for-investigation.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<auto_mode>

## Auto Mode Detection

Check if `--auto` flag is present in $ARGUMENTS.

**If auto mode:**

- Auto mode compresses intake; it does not override autonomy review gates after the scoping contract is approved
- Do not assume scope is already correct just because a document exists
- Existing-work routing may be compressed to one lightweight question, but cannot be skipped when prior artifacts are detected
- Skip full deep questioning, but still synthesize a scoping contract from the supplied document
- Ask at most one repair prompt if blocking scoping fields are missing
- Config questions still required (Step 5)
- Require one explicit scoping approval gate before requirements and roadmap generation
- After config and scope approval: run Steps 6-9 automatically with smart defaults:
  - Literature survey: Always yes
  - Research questions: Include all from provided document
  - Research questions approval: Use approved scoping contract as source of truth
  - Roadmap approval: Auto-approve only for `balanced` / `yolo`; if `autonomy=supervised`, present the draft roadmap before commit

**Document requirement:**
Auto mode requires a research document via @ reference (e.g., `/gpd-new-project --auto @proposal.md`). If no document provided, error:

```
Error: --auto requires a research document via @ reference.

Usage: /gpd-new-project --auto @your-proposal.md

The document should describe the physics problem you want to investigate.
```

</auto_mode>

<minimal_mode>

## Minimal Mode Detection

Check if `--minimal` flag is present in $ARGUMENTS.

**If minimal mode:** After Step 1 (Setup), skip the entire standard flow (Steps 2-9) and execute the **Minimal Initialization Path** below instead.

Minimal mode creates the SAME directory structure and file set as the full path -- just with less conversational overhead. It still must produce a scoping contract with decisive outputs, anchors, and explicit approval so downstream workflows (`/gpd-plan-phase`, `/gpd-execute-phase`, etc.) work identically.

**Two variants:**

1. `--minimal @file.md` — Input file provided. Parse it for research context.
2. `--minimal` (no file) — Ask ONE question, then generate everything from the response.

---

### Minimal Initialization Path

**After Step 1 completes (init checks, git, project_exists guard):**

#### M1. Gather Research Context

**If `--minimal` with file** (`/gpd-new-project --minimal @plan.md`):

Parse the input markdown for:

- **Research question** — Look for headings like "Research Question", "Objective", "Goal", or the first substantive paragraph
- **Decisive observables and deliverables** — Look for explicit plots, figures, datasets, calculations, derivations, or benchmark outputs the user says matter
- **Existing decomposition, if any** — Look for numbered lists, headings like "Phases", "Plan", "Steps", "Milestones", or any clear sequence of investigation chunks. Treat these as optional grounding, not as a setup prerequisite.
- **Key parameters** — Look for mentions of physical parameters, coupling constants, energy scales, system sizes
- **Theoretical framework** — Infer from terminology (QFT, condensed matter, GR, statistical mechanics, etc.)
- **Computational tools** — Any mentioned software, libraries, or numerical methods
- **Must-keep context** — Look for must-read references, benchmark values, prior outputs, figures, notebooks, and any stop/rethink conditions

If the file cannot be parsed (no discernible research question or objective), error:

```
Error: Could not extract research context from the provided file.

The file should contain at minimum:
- A research question or objective

It should ideally also name at least one decisive output, anchor, prior output, or explicit "anchor unknown / need grounding" note so any repair prompt can stay narrow.

Example structure:
  # Research Question
  What is the critical exponent of the 3D Ising model?

  # Success Signal
  Extract the critical exponent and compare it against a trusted benchmark.

  # Anchors
  Compare against the known 3D Ising result from the literature.

  # Optional First Investigation Chunk
  Set up the Monte Carlo simulation and finite-size scaling workflow.
```

**If `--minimal` without file** (`/gpd-new-project --minimal`):

Ask ONE question inline (freeform, NOT question):

"Describe your research project in one pass: what's the core question, what output, claim, or deliverable would count as success, what references, prior outputs, or known results must stay visible, whether the anchor is still unknown, any first investigation chunk you already know, and what would make you rethink the approach?"

Wait for response. From the single response, extract:

- Research question
- Theoretical framework
- Any decisive outputs, anchors, prior outputs, or explicit context gaps
- Any mentioned parameters, tools, constraints, or initial investigation chunk

#### M1.5. Synthesize And Approve The Scoping Contract

Build a canonical scoping contract from the extracted input.

**Blocking fields that must be present before approval:**

- Core question
- At least one decisive output, claim, or deliverable
- At least one anchor, reference/prior-output constraint, or an explicit "anchor unknown / must establish later" note

**Fields to capture even if still uncertain:**

- In-scope and out-of-scope boundaries
- Must-read references, benchmarks, or prior outputs
- User-stated observables, deliverables, decisive plots, or artifact expectations
- User-stated stop conditions, rethink triggers, or "come back to me before continuing" guidance
- Initial investigation chunk or decomposition sketch if the user already knows it
- Weakest anchor
- What would look like progress but should not count as success
- What result would make the current framing look wrong or incomplete
- Unresolved questions / context gaps

**Preservation rule:** If the user names a specific observable, figure, dataset, derivation, paper, benchmark, notebook, prior run, or stop condition, keep that wording recognizable in the contract. Do not generalize it away into a vague proxy.
If the user does not know the anchor yet, preserve that explicitly in `scope.unresolved_questions` or `context_intake.context_gaps` rather than inventing a paper, benchmark, or baseline.
Prefer explicit missing-anchor wording such as `Which reference should serve as the decisive benchmark anchor?`, `Benchmark reference not yet selected`, `still to identify the decisive anchor`, or `baseline comparison is TBD`.
Do not force a phase list just to make the scoping contract look complete. If decomposition is still unclear, record that uncertainty and let `ROADMAP.md` start with a single coarse phase or first grounded investigation chunk.

If a blocking field is missing, ask exactly one repair prompt that targets only the missing field. Do not silently continue with placeholders.

Before you show the approval gate, build the raw contract as a literal JSON object that follows `templates/state-json-schema.md` exactly:

- `project_contract` is a JSON object, not prose
- `observables`, `claims`, `deliverables`, `acceptance_tests`, `references`, `forbidden_proxies`, and `links` are arrays of objects, not strings
- every object in those arrays must declare a stable `id`
- `context_intake.must_read_refs` must contain only `references[].id` values
- `claims[].observables`, `claims[].deliverables`, `claims[].acceptance_tests`, and `claims[].references` must point only to declared IDs
- `acceptance_tests[].subject`, `references[].applies_to`, and `forbidden_proxies[].subject` must point to a claim ID or deliverable ID, never an observable label or free text
- `acceptance_tests[].evidence_required`, `links[].source`, and `links[].target` may only point to declared claim, deliverable, acceptance-test, or reference IDs
- for enum fields, use only the exact schema vocabulary:
  - `observables[].kind`: `scalar | curve | map | classification | proof_obligation | other`
  - `deliverables[].kind`: `figure | table | dataset | data | derivation | code | note | report | other`
  - `acceptance_tests[].kind`: `existence | schema | benchmark | consistency | cross_method | limiting_case | symmetry | dimensional_analysis | convergence | oracle | proxy | reproducibility | human_review | other`
  - `acceptance_tests[].automation`: `automated | hybrid | human`
  - `references[].kind`: `paper | dataset | prior_artifact | spec | user_anchor | other`
  - `references[].role`: `definition | benchmark | method | must_consider | background | other`
  - `links[].relation`: `supports | computes | visualizes | benchmarks | depends_on | evaluated_by | other`
  - `references[].carry_forward_to[]` is free-text workflow scope such as `planning`, `execution`, `verification`, or `writing`; it is not an enum and must not be reused for IDs or relation names
- do **not** invent near-miss enum values such as `anchor`, `manual`, `content-check`, `benchmark-record`, or `anchors`; rewrite them to the exact schema term before approval
- if the user chooses "Review raw contract", show the exact JSON object that will be validated and persisted

Then present a concise scoping summary and require explicit approval:

- header: "Scope"
- question: "Does this scoping contract look right before I generate the project artifacts?"
- options:
  - "Approve scope" -- proceed
  - "Adjust scope" -- revise before writing files
  - "Review raw contract" -- show the structured contract
  - "Stop here" -- do not create downstream artifacts

**CRITICAL:** Minimal mode is still allowed to be lean, but it is not allowed to be contract-free.

After approval, validate the contract before persisting it:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$PROJECT_CONTRACT_JSON" | gpd --raw validate project-contract -
```

If validation fails, show the errors, revise the scoping contract, and do NOT continue to downstream artifact generation.

After validation passes, persist the approved contract into `.gpd/state.json` from the same stdin payload:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$PROJECT_CONTRACT_JSON" | gpd state set-project-contract -
```

Do not write `/tmp` intermediates for the approved contract. Prefer piping the exact approved JSON directly to `gpd ... -`. Only write a file if the user explicitly wants a durable saved copy, and if so place it under the project, not an OS temp directory.

#### M2. Create PROJECT.md

Populate `.gpd/PROJECT.md` using the template from `templates/project.md`.

Fill in what was extracted. For sections without enough information, use sensible placeholder text that signals incompleteness:

```markdown
# [Extracted Research Title]

## What This Is

[Extracted research description — keep it concise, 2-3 sentences from the input]

## Core Research Question

[Extracted research question]

## Scoping Contract Summary

### Contract Coverage

- [Claim / deliverable]: [What counts as success]

- [False progress to reject]: [Proxy that must not count]

### User Guidance To Preserve

- **User-stated observables:** [Specific quantity, curve, figure, or smoking-gun signal]
- **User-stated deliverables:** [Specific table, plot, derivation, dataset, note, or code output]
- **Must-have references / prior outputs:** [Paper, notebook, run, figure, or benchmark that must remain visible]
- **Stop / rethink conditions:** [When to pause, ask again, or re-scope before continuing]

---

_Last updated: [today's date] after initialization (minimal)_
```

#### M3. Create REQUIREMENTS.md

Auto-generate REQ-IDs from the phase goals or major work chunks extracted in M1.

For each phase, create one or more requirements using the standard format:

```markdown
# Research Requirements

## Current Requirements

### Phase-Derived Requirements

[For each confirmed phase or work chunk, generate requirements with REQ-IDs:]

- [ ] **REQ-01**: [Goal of phase 1, made specific and testable]
- [ ] **REQ-02**: [Goal of phase 2, made specific and testable]
- [ ] **REQ-03**: [Goal of phase 3, made specific and testable]
      [... one per confirmed phase or work chunk minimum ...]

## Future Work

(To be identified as project progresses)

## Out of Scope

(To be refined — use /gpd-settings or edit REQUIREMENTS.md directly)

## Traceability

| REQ-ID | Phase | Status  |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| REQ-01 | 1     | Planned |
| REQ-02 | 2     | Planned |
| REQ-03 | 3     | Planned |
```

#### M4. Create ROADMAP.md

Create `.gpd/ROADMAP.md` directly from the phase descriptions or inferred work chunks (no roadmapper agent).

Use the coarsest decomposition the approved contract actually supports. If the input only supports one grounded stage so far, create a one-phase roadmap and carry later decomposition as an open question instead of inventing filler phases.

Use the standard roadmap template structure:

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Research Project Title]

## Overview

[One paragraph synthesized from the research description]

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: [Phase name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 2: [Phase name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 3: [Phase name]** - [One-line description]
      [... from extracted or inferred stages/work chunks ...]

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: [Phase name]

**Goal:** [Extracted from input]
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements:** [REQ-01]
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. [Derived from phase goal — one concrete observable outcome]
2. [Second criterion if obvious from context]

Plans:

- [ ] 01-01: [TBD — created during /gpd-plan-phase]

[... repeat for each phase ...]

## Progress

| Phase     | Plans Complete | Status      | Completed |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1. [Name] | 0/TBD          | Not started | -         |
| 2. [Name] | 0/TBD          | Not started | -         |
| 3. [Name] | 0/TBD          | Not started | -         |
```

#### M5. Create STATE.md and config.json

**STATE.md** — Initialize using the standard template:

```markdown
# Research State

## Project Reference

See: .gpd/PROJECT.md (updated [today's date])

**Core research question:** [From PROJECT.md]
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — [Phase 1 name]

## Current Position

**Current Phase:** 1
**Current Phase Name:** [Phase 1 name]
**Total Phases:** [N]
**Current Plan:** 0
**Total Plans in Phase:** 0
**Status:** Ready to plan
**Last Activity:** [today's date]
**Last Activity Description:** Project initialized (minimal)

**Progress:** [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Active Calculations

## Open Questions

[Populate from approved scoping-contract unresolved questions. If none, say "None yet."]

## Performance Metrics

| Label | Duration | Tasks | Files |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| -     | -        | -     | -     |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Phase 1]: Minimal mode — scoping contract approved before phase planning

### Active Approximations

None yet.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** [today's date]
**Stopped at:** Project initialized (minimal)
**Resume file:** —
```

**config.json** — Create with sensible defaults (no config questions asked):

```json
{
  "autonomy": "balanced",
  "research_mode": "balanced",
  "execution": {
    "review_cadence": "adaptive"
  },
  "parallelization": true,
  "commit_docs": true,
  "model_profile": "review",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true,
    "plan_checker": true,
    "verifier": true
  }
}
```

#### M6. Commit All Artifacts

Create the directory structure and commit everything in a single commit:

```bash
mkdir -p .gpd

PRE_CHECK=$(gpd pre-commit-check --files .gpd/PROJECT.md .gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md .gpd/ROADMAP.md .gpd/STATE.md .gpd/state.json .gpd/config.json 2>&1) || true
echo "$PRE_CHECK"

gpd commit "docs: initialize research project (minimal)" --files .gpd/PROJECT.md .gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md .gpd/ROADMAP.md .gpd/STATE.md .gpd/state.json .gpd/config.json
```

#### M7. Done — Offer Next Step

```

## >> Next Up

**Phase 1: [Phase Name]** — [Goal from ROADMAP.md]

Use question:

- header: "Next Step"
- question: "Plan phase 1 now?"
- options:
  - "Plan phase 1" — Run /gpd-plan-phase 1
  - "Review artifacts first" — I want to check the generated files
  - "Done for now" — I'll continue later

**If "Plan phase 1":** Tell the user to run `/gpd-plan-phase 1` (and suggest `/clear` first for a fresh context window).

**If "Review artifacts first":** List the files and let the user inspect them. Suggest edits if needed, then re-offer planning.

**If "Done for now":** Exit. Remind them to use `/gpd-resume-work` or `/gpd-plan-phase 1` when ready.

---

**End of Minimal Initialization Path.** The standard flow (Steps 2-9) is not executed when `--minimal` is active.

</minimal_mode>

<process>

## 1. Setup

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — Execute these checks before ANY user interaction:**

```bash
INIT=$(gpd init new-project)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd initialization failed: $INIT"
  # STOP — display the error to the user and do not proceed with the workflow.
fi
```

Parse JSON for: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`, `commit_docs`, `autonomy`, `research_mode`, `project_exists`, `has_research_map`, `planning_exists`, `has_research_files`, `has_project_manifest`, `has_existing_project`, `needs_research_map`, `has_git`.

**Mode-aware behavior:**
- `autonomy=supervised`: Pause for user confirmation after each major step (questioning, scoping contract, research, roadmap). Show summaries and wait for approval before proceeding.
- `autonomy=balanced` (default): Execute the full pipeline automatically. Pause only if research results are ambiguous, the roadmap has gaps, or scope-setting decisions need user judgment. The initial scoping contract is always a user-judgment checkpoint.
- `autonomy=yolo`: Execute full pipeline, skip optional literature survey, auto-approve roadmap. Do NOT skip the initial scoping-contract approval gate. Do NOT skip the requirement to show contract coverage in the roadmap.
- `--auto` changes how intake happens, not who owns later review gates. If `autonomy=supervised`, keep the roadmap approval checkpoint even in auto mode.
- `research_mode=explore`: Expand literature survey (spawn 5+ researchers), broader questioning, include speculative research directions in roadmap.
- `research_mode=exploit`: Focused literature survey (2-3 researchers), targeted questioning, lean roadmap with minimal exploratory phases.
- `research_mode=adaptive`: Start broad enough to compare viable approaches while scoping the project. Narrow the roadmap only after anchors or decisive evidence make one method family clearly preferable.
- Before `.gpd/config.json` exists, the `autonomy` and `research_mode` values from `gpd init new-project` are temporary defaults, not a durable user choice. Let those defaults govern the initial questioning and scoping pass, then run Step 5 immediately after scope approval and before the first project-artifact commit so the durable config takes over before research and roadmap execution.

**If `project_exists` is true:** Error — project already initialized. Use `/gpd-progress`.

**If `has_git` is false:** Initialize git:

```bash
git init
```

**Check for previous initialization attempt:**

```bash
if [ -f .gpd/init-progress.json ]; then
  # Guard against corrupted JSON (e.g., from interrupted write)
  PREV_STEP=""
  PREV_DESC=""
  INIT_PROGRESS_RAW=$(cat .gpd/init-progress.json 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  if [ -n "$INIT_PROGRESS_RAW" ]; then
    PREV_STEP=$(echo "$INIT_PROGRESS_RAW" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.loads(sys.stdin.read()); print(d.get('step',''))" 2>/dev/null)
    PREV_DESC=$(echo "$INIT_PROGRESS_RAW" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.loads(sys.stdin.read()); print(d.get('description',''))" 2>/dev/null)
  fi

  # If JSON was corrupted (empty step), treat as fresh start
  if [ -z "$PREV_STEP" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: init-progress.json exists but is corrupted or empty. Starting fresh."
    rm -f .gpd/init-progress.json
  fi
fi
```

If `init-progress.json` exists and is valid, offer to resume:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GPD > PREVIOUS INITIALIZATION DETECTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Completed through step {PREV_STEP}: {PREV_DESC}

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Options:
  1. "Resume from step {PREV_STEP + 1}" -- continue where you left off
  2. "Start fresh" -- re-run from the beginning
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

If resume: skip to the step after PREV_STEP (check which artifacts already exist on disk to confirm).
If start fresh: delete `init-progress.json` and proceed normally.

## 2. Existing Work Offer

**If auto mode:** Do not offer the full mapping flow by default, but do NOT assume a fresh project if prior artifacts exist. If `needs_research_map` is true or existing artifacts are detected, ask one lightweight routing question:

- header: "Existing Work"
- question: "Should I treat the supplied document as a fresh project, or as a continuation that must carry forward existing outputs?"
- options:
  - "Fresh project" -- synthesize scope from the document only
  - "Continuation" -- include existing outputs and baselines as contract inputs

If no prior artifacts are detected, continue directly to Step 3 / Step 4 as appropriate.

**If `needs_research_map` is true** (from init — existing research artifacts detected but no research map):

> **Platform note:** If `question` is not available, present these options in plain text and wait for the user's freeform response.

Use question:

- header: "Existing Research"
- question: "I detected existing research artifacts in this directory. Would you like to map the existing work first?"
- options:
  - "Map existing work first" — Run /gpd-map-research to understand current research state (Recommended)
  - "Skip mapping" — Proceed with fresh project initialization

**If "Map existing work first":**

```
Run `/gpd-map-research` first, then return to `/gpd-new-project`
```

Exit command.

**If "Skip mapping" OR `needs_research_map` is false:** Continue to Step 3.

## 3. Deep Questioning

**If auto mode:** Skip. Extract research context from provided document instead and proceed to Step 4.

**Display stage banner:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GPD >>> RESEARCH QUESTION FORMULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Open the conversation:**

Ask inline (freeform, NOT question):

"What physics problem do you want to investigate?"

Wait for their response. This gives you the context needed to ask intelligent follow-up questions.

**Follow the thread:**

Based on what they said, ask follow-up questions that dig into their response. Use question with options that probe what they mentioned — interpretations, clarifications, concrete examples.

Keep following threads. Each answer opens new threads to explore. Ask about:

- What physical system or phenomenon motivated this
- What they currently suspect about the answer, and what evidence would change their mind
- What theoretical framework they are working in
- What approximations or limits they are considering
- What observable or measurable quantities they care about
- What exact output, artifact, or benchmark would count as success
- What exact observable, figure, derivation, dataset, or note they would personally look for first
- What first smoking-gun observable, curve, benchmark reproduction, or scaling law they would trust before softer sanity checks
- What would look like progress but should not count as success
- Whether passing limiting cases, generic expectations, or qualitative agreement without that smoking gun should still count as failure
- What references, benchmark results, datasets, or prior internal outputs must stay visible
- What prior plots, notebooks, code outputs, or existing artifacts already matter and must not be ignored
- What should make the system stop, re-scope, or ask them again before a long execution branch
- Which anchor or assumption feels weakest right now
- What result would make the current framing look wrong or incomplete
- What computational resources they have access to
- Whether this connects to existing experimental data

If the user names a specific observable, deliverable, anchor paper, benchmark, figure, notebook, or prior result, reflect it back using recognizable wording and treat it as binding context unless the user later revises it.

Consult `./.opencode/get-physics-done/references/research/questioning.md` for techniques:

- Challenge vagueness ("What do you mean by 'interesting regime'?")
- Make abstract concrete ("Can you write down the Hamiltonian?")
- Surface assumptions ("Are you assuming equilibrium? Why?")
- Find edges ("What happens at strong coupling?")
- Reveal motivation ("What would change if you solved this?")
- Surface anchors ("What do we trust as ground truth here?")
- Demand the smoking gun ("What exact check would make you trust this over softer sanity checks?")
- Force one disconfirming question ("What would make this framing look wrong?")
- Reject proxies ("What should not count as done?")

**Check context (background, not out loud):**

As you go, mentally check the context checklist from `./.opencode/get-physics-done/references/research/questioning.md`. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally. Don't suddenly switch to checklist mode.

Context to gather:

- Research question (precise, falsifiable or answerable)
- Physical system and regime
- Theoretical framework (QFT, condensed matter, GR, statistical mechanics, etc.)
- Key parameters and scales
- User-stated observables, smoking-gun signals, or decisive plots
- Decisive outputs, deliverables, or benchmark targets
- Must-read references, baselines, and prior outputs to carry forward
- User-stated stop conditions, rethink triggers, or review requests before long execution
- Known results in the field (what has been done)
- What is new or open (what has NOT been done)
- Computational vs analytical approach preference
- Target audience and venue (journal, conference)
- Timeline and collaboration context
- Available computational resources
- Weakest anchor or assumption
- Disconfirming observation / change-course trigger
- False-progress signals to reject

**Decision gate:**

When you could write a clear scoping contract, use question:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand the research direction, the decisive outputs, and the anchors we need to respect. Ready to create PROJECT.md?"
- options:
  - "Create PROJECT.md" — Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" — I want to share more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" — ask what they want to add, or identify gaps and probe naturally.

Avoid rigid turn-counting. After several substantive exchanges, if you can state the core question, one decisive output or deliverable, and at least one anchor (or an explicit "anchor unknown" note), offer to proceed. If those blocking fields are still missing after roughly 6 follow-ups, summarize what is missing and ask whether to keep exploring or proceed with explicit open questions. A full phase breakdown is not required at this stage; if only the first grounded investigation chunk is clear, say so and carry later decomposition as an open question. Do not force closure just because a counter was hit, and do not imply certainty where there is still ambiguity.
If you only have limiting cases, sanity checks, or generic benchmark language with no decisive smoking-gun observable, curve, or benchmark reproduction, keep exploring unless the user explicitly says that is the decisive standard.

## 4. Synthesize The Approved Project Contract And Write PROJECT.md

**If auto mode:** Synthesize the scoping contract from the provided document, ask at most one repair prompt for blocking gaps, and require one explicit scope approval before continuing.

Before writing `PROJECT.md`, synthesize a canonical project contract with at least these elements:

- `scope.question`
- `scope.in_scope`
- `scope.out_of_scope`
- `scope.unresolved_questions`
- `context_intake.must_read_refs`
- `context_intake.must_include_prior_outputs`
- `context_intake.user_asserted_anchors`
- `context_intake.known_good_baselines`
- `context_intake.context_gaps`
- `context_intake.crucial_inputs` for user-stated observables, deliverables, stop conditions, or anything the user said must stay visible
- `observables` for any user-named decisive quantity, signal, or behavior, especially the first smoking-gun check they would trust over softer proxies or limiting cases
- at least one decisive claim, observable, or deliverable
- any forbidden proxy or false-progress signal that the user called out
- `uncertainty_markers.weakest_anchors`
- `uncertainty_markers.unvalidated_assumptions`
- `uncertainty_markers.competing_explanations`
- `uncertainty_markers.disconfirming_observations`

If no must-read references are confirmed yet, record that explicitly in the contract rather than inventing one.
If the user does not know the anchor yet, record that explicitly as an unresolved question or context gap rather than fabricating a paper, dataset, benchmark, or baseline.
If the user supplied explicit observables, deliverables, prior outputs, or stop conditions, preserve them in the contract using wording the user would still recognize. Do not paraphrase them into generic "benchmark" or "artifact" language unless the user asked you to broaden them.
If the user named a prior output, review checkpoint, or "come back to me before continuing" condition, carry it into `context_intake.must_include_prior_outputs` or `context_intake.crucial_inputs` rather than leaving it only in prose.
Do not approve a scoping contract that strips decisive outputs, anchors, prior outputs, or review/stop triggers down to generic placeholders. The approved contract must preserve the user guidance that downstream planning needs.
If the only checks captured so far are limiting cases, sanity checks, or qualitative expectations, treat the contract as still underspecified unless the user explicitly states that these are the decisive standard.

Before you ask for approval, build the raw contract as a literal JSON object that follows `templates/state-json-schema.md` exactly:

- `project_contract` is a JSON object, not prose
- `observables`, `claims`, `deliverables`, `acceptance_tests`, `references`, `forbidden_proxies`, and `links` are arrays of objects, not strings
- every object in those arrays must declare a stable `id`
- `context_intake.must_read_refs` must contain only `references[].id` values
- `claims[].observables`, `claims[].deliverables`, `claims[].acceptance_tests`, and `claims[].references` must point only to declared IDs
- `acceptance_tests[].subject`, `references[].applies_to`, and `forbidden_proxies[].subject` must point to a claim ID or deliverable ID, never an observable label or free text
- `acceptance_tests[].evidence_required`, `links[].source`, and `links[].target` may only point to declared claim, deliverable, acceptance-test, or reference IDs
- if the user chooses "Review raw contract", show the exact JSON object that will be validated and persisted

Present a concise scoping summary and require explicit approval before downstream artifact generation:

- header: "Scope"
- question: "Does this scoping contract look right before I generate project artifacts?"
- options:
  - "Approve scope" -- proceed
  - "Adjust scope" -- revise the contract before writing files
  - "Review raw contract" -- show the structured contract
  - "Stop here" -- exit without creating downstream artifacts

Validate the approved contract before persisting it:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$PROJECT_CONTRACT_JSON" | gpd --raw validate project-contract -
```

If validation fails, show the errors, revise the scoping contract, and do NOT continue.

Persist the approved contract into `.gpd/state.json` from the same stdin payload:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$PROJECT_CONTRACT_JSON" | gpd state set-project-contract -
```

Do not write `/tmp` intermediates for the approved contract. Prefer piping the exact approved JSON directly to `gpd ... -`. Only write a file if the user explicitly wants a durable saved copy, and if so place it under the project, not an OS temp directory.

If `.gpd/config.json` does not exist yet, run Step 5 now before generating or committing `PROJECT.md`. This keeps the opening focused on the physics question while still letting `commit_docs` and other durable workflow settings apply before the first project-artifact commit. After Step 5 completes, return here and continue.

Then synthesize all context into `.gpd/PROJECT.md` using the template from `templates/project.md`.

**For fresh research projects:**

Initialize research questions as hypotheses:

```markdown
## Research Questions

### Answered

(None yet — investigate to answer)

### Active

- [ ] [Research question 1]
- [ ] [Research question 2]
- [ ] [Research question 3]

### Out of Scope

- [Question 1] — [why: e.g., requires experiment, different subfield]
- [Question 2] — [why]
```

**For continuation projects (existing work map exists):**

Infer answered questions from existing work:

1. Read `.gpd/research-map/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `FORMALISM.md`
2. Identify what has already been established
3. These become the initial Answered set

```markdown
## Research Questions

### Answered

- [checkmark] [Existing result 1] — established
- [checkmark] [Existing result 2] — established
- [checkmark] [Existing result 3] — established

### Active

- [ ] [New question 1]
- [ ] [New question 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Question 1] — [why]
```

**Scoping Contract Summary:**

Ensure PROJECT.md visibly summarizes the approved contract, including:

```markdown
## Scoping Contract Summary

### Contract Coverage

- [Claim / deliverable]: [What counts as success]
- [Acceptance signal]: [Benchmark match, proof obligation, figure, dataset, or note]
- [False progress to reject]: [Proxy that must not count]

### Scope Boundaries

**In scope**

- [Approved in-scope item]

**Out of scope**

- [Approved out-of-scope item]

### Active Anchor Registry

- [Anchor ID or short label]: [Paper, dataset, spec, benchmark, or prior artifact]
  - Why it matters: [What it constrains]
  - Carry forward: [planning | execution | verification | writing]
  - Required action: [read | use | compare | cite | avoid]

### Carry-Forward Inputs

- [Prior output, notebook, figure, baseline, or "None confirmed yet"]

### Skeptical Review

- **Weakest anchor:** [Least-certain assumption, reference, or prior result]
- **Unvalidated assumptions:** [What is currently assumed rather than checked]
- **Competing explanation:** [Alternative story that could also fit]
- **Disconfirming observation:** [What would make the framing look wrong]
- **False progress to reject:** [What might look promising but should not count as success]

### Open Contract Questions

- [Unresolved question or context gap]
```

**Key Decisions:**

Initialize with any decisions made during questioning:

```markdown
## Key Decisions

| Decision                  | Rationale | Outcome   |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| [Choice from questioning] | [Why]     | — Pending |
```

**Research Context:**

```markdown
## Research Context

### Physical System

[Description of the system under study]

### Theoretical Framework

[QFT / condensed matter / GR / statistical mechanics / etc.]

### Key Parameters and Scales

| Parameter | Symbol | Regime  | Notes   |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| [param 1] | [sym]  | [range] | [notes] |

### Known Results

- [Prior work 1] — [reference]
- [Prior work 2] — [reference]

### What Is New

[What this project contributes beyond existing work]

### Target Venue

[Journal or conference, with rationale]

### Computational Environment

[Available resources: local workstation, cluster, cloud, specific codes]
```

{"step": 4, "completed_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)", "description": "Approved project contract and PROJECT.md created and committed"}
CHECKPOINT
```

## 5. Workflow Preferences

**Quick setup gate — offer recommended defaults before individual questions:**

Run this step after scope approval and before the first project-artifact commit whenever `.gpd/config.json` does not exist yet.

Use question:

- header: "Workflow Setup"
- question: "How would you like to write `.gpd/config.json`? Recommended defaults set `autonomy=balanced`, `research_mode=balanced`, `parallelization=true`, `commit_docs=true`, `model_profile=review`, and enable `workflow.research`, `workflow.plan_checker`, and `workflow.verifier`."
- options:
  - "Use recommended defaults (Recommended)" — write those exact values now. Saves 3-5 minutes.
  - "Customize settings" — choose `autonomy`, `research_mode`, `parallelization`, `commit_docs`, workflow agents, and `model_profile` individually

**If "Use recommended defaults":** Skip all 8 config questions below. Create config.json directly with:

```json
{
  "autonomy": "balanced",
  "research_mode": "balanced",
  "parallelization": true,
  "commit_docs": true,
  "model_profile": "review",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true,
    "plan_checker": true,
    "verifier": true
  }
}
```

Display confirmation:

```
Config: Balanced autonomy | Adaptive review cadence | Balanced research mode | Parallel | All agents | Review profile
(Change anytime with /gpd-settings)
```

Skip to "Commit config.json" below.

**If "Customize settings":** Proceed through Round 1 and Round 2 below.

---

**Round 1 — Core workflow settings (4 questions):**

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Autonomy",
    question: "How much autonomy should GPD have?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Routine work is automatic; pause on important physics decisions, ambiguities, blockers, or scope changes" },
      { label: "YOLO", description: "Fastest mode. Auto-approve checkpoints and keep going unless a hard stop fires" },
      { label: "Supervised", description: "Confirm each major step before proceeding" }

    question: "Run plans in parallel?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Parallel (Recommended)", description: "Independent plans run simultaneously" },
      { label: "Sequential", description: "One plan at a time" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Git Tracking",
    question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep .gpd/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Round 2 — Workflow agents (only if customizing):**

These spawn additional agents during planning/execution. They add tokens and time but improve quality.

| Agent                   | When it runs               | What it does                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Literature Scout**    | Before planning each phase | Surveys relevant literature, finds key references, surfaces known results           |
| **Derivation Checker**  | After plan is created      | Verifies mathematical consistency and completeness of proposed approach             |
| **Validation Verifier** | After phase execution      | Confirms results satisfy physical constraints, limiting cases, and known benchmarks |

All recommended for rigorous research. Skip for quick exploratory calculations.

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Literature Survey",
    question: "Survey literature before planning each phase? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Find relevant references, known results, standard methods" },
      { label: "No", description: "Plan directly from research questions" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Derivation Check",
    question: "Verify mathematical approach before execution? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Catch errors in formulation before computing" },
      { label: "No", description: "Execute approach without mathematical pre-check" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Validation",

    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Check limiting cases, conservation laws, dimensional analysis" },
      { label: "No", description: "Trust results, skip systematic validation" }
    ]
  },

    question: "Which AI models for planning agents?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Review (Recommended)", description: "Balanced cost/quality — tier-1 for critical agents, tier-2 for others" },

      { label: "Paper Writing", description: "Bias model selection toward manuscript drafting and polishing" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Create `.gpd/config.json` with all settings:

```json
{
  "autonomy": "supervised|balanced|yolo",
  "research_mode": "explore|balanced|exploit|adaptive",
  "parallelization": true|false,
  "commit_docs": true|false,
  "model_profile": "deep-theory|numerical|exploratory|review|paper-writing",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true|false,
    "plan_checker": true|false,
    "verifier": true|false
  }
}
```

**If commit_docs = No:**

- Set `commit_docs: false` in config.json
- Add `.gpd/` to `.gitignore` (create if needed)

**If commit_docs = Yes:**

- No additional gitignore entries needed

**Commit config.json:**

```bash
PRE_CHECK=$(gpd pre-commit-check --files .gpd/config.json 2>&1) || true
echo "$PRE_CHECK"

gpd commit "chore: add project config" --files .gpd/config.json
```

**Checkpoint step 5:**

```bash
cat > .gpd/init-progress.json << CHECKPOINT
{"step": 5, "completed_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)", "description": "config.json created and committed"}
CHECKPOINT
```

**Note:** Run `/gpd-settings` anytime to update these preferences.

## 5.5. Resolve Model Profile

Use models from init: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`.

## 6. Literature Survey Decision

**If auto mode:** Default to "Survey first" without asking.

Use question:

- header: "Literature Survey"
- question: "Survey the research landscape before defining the investigation plan?"
- options:
  - "Survey first (Recommended)" — Discover known results, standard methods, open problems, available data
  - "Skip survey" — I know this field well, go straight to planning

**If "Survey first":**

Display stage banner:

Create research directory:

```bash

**Determine project context:**

Check if this is a fresh project or continuation:

- If no "Answered" research questions in PROJECT.md → Fresh project (starting from scratch)
- If "Answered" questions exist → Continuation (building on existing results)

```

**Load context:**

Read PROJECT.md and `.gpd/state.json` and extract:

- Core research question (the ONE thing that must be answered)
- Stated constraints (computational resources, timeline, method limitations)
- Any explicit scope boundaries
- The approved `project_contract`
- Decisive outputs, deliverables, and forbidden proxies from the contract
- Must-read references, prior outputs, and known baselines from the contract

**If literature survey exists:** Read research/METHODS.md and PRIOR-WORK.md and extract available approaches.

**If auto mode:**

- Auto-include all essential research requirements (directly answer the core question and satisfy the approved contract)
- Include requirements explicitly mentioned in provided document
- Auto-defer tangential investigations not mentioned in document
- Skip per-category question loops
- Skip "Any additions?" question
- Skip requirements approval gate
- Generate REQUIREMENTS.md and commit directly

**Present requirements by category (interactive mode only):**

```
Here are the research requirements for [domain]:

## Analytical Derivations
**Essential:**
- Derive the effective Hamiltonian in the [regime] limit
- Compute the [observable] to leading order in [parameter]

**Extended:**
- Include next-to-leading order corrections
- Explore connection to [related framework]

**Literature notes:** [any relevant notes]

---

## Numerical Validation
...
```

**If no literature survey:** Gather requirements through conversation instead.

Ask: "What are the key results you need to establish?"

For each objective mentioned:

- Ask clarifying questions to make it precise
- Probe for related calculations
- Group into categories (analytical, numerical, phenomenological)

**Scope each category:**

For each category, use question:

- header: "[Category name]"
- question: "Which [category] requirements are in scope?"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "[Objective 1]" — [brief description]
  - "[Objective 2]" — [brief description]
  - "[Objective 3]" — [brief description]
  - "None for now" — Defer entire category

Track responses:

- Selected requirements → current investigation
- Unselected essential → future work
- Unselected extended → out of scope

**Identify gaps:**

Use question:

- header: "Additions"
- question: "Any requirements the literature survey missed? (Calculations specific to your approach)"
- options:
  - "No, survey covered it" — Proceed
  - "Yes, let me add some" — Capture additions

**Validate core question:**

Cross-check requirements against Core Research Question from PROJECT.md. If gaps detected, surface them.

**Generate REQUIREMENTS.md:**

Create `.gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md` with:

- Current Requirements grouped by category (checkboxes, REQ-IDs)
- Future Requirements (deferred)
- Out of Scope (explicit exclusions with reasoning)
- Contract Coverage section mapping requirements to decisive outputs, anchors, baselines, and false-progress risks
- Traceability section (empty, filled by roadmap)

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (ANAL-01, NUMR-02, PHENO-03)

**Objective quality criteria:**

Good research requirements are:

- **Specific and testable:** "Compute the spectral gap as a function of coupling g" (not "Study the spectrum")
- **Result-oriented:** "Derive expression for X" or "Determine whether Y holds" (not "Think about Z")
- **Atomic:** One calculation or result per requirement (not "Derive and numerically validate the phase diagram")
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies on other requirements

Reject vague requirements. Push for specificity:

- "Study the phase transition" → "Determine the critical exponent nu for the [model] phase transition using [method]"
- "Compute correlators" → "Compute the two-point correlation function G(r) in the [regime] and extract the correlation length"

**Present full requirements list (interactive mode only):**

Show every requirement (not counts) for user confirmation:

```

## 8. Create Roadmap

Display stage banner:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GPD >>> CREATING RESEARCH ROADMAP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

>>> Spawning roadmapper...
```

Spawn gpd-roadmapper agent with context:

```
task(prompt="First, read ./.opencode/agents/gpd-roadmapper.md for your role and instructions.

<planning_context>

**Read these files before proceeding:**
- `.gpd/PROJECT.md` — Project definition and research question
- `.gpd/state.json` — Approved project contract in `project_contract`
- `.gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md` — Derived requirements
- `.gpd/research/SUMMARY.md` — Literature survey (if exists)
- `.gpd/config.json` — Project configuration

</planning_context>

<instructions>
Create research roadmap:
1. Derive phases from requirements AND the approved project contract. Use the smallest decomposition that keeps decisive outputs, anchor handoffs, and verification legible. A tightly scoped project may have a single phase or a coarse early roadmap. Do NOT invent literature, numerics, or paper phases unless the requirements or contract demand them.
2. Map every requirement to exactly one phase
3. For each phase, include explicit contract coverage in ROADMAP.md showing the decisive contract items, deliverables, anchor coverage, and forbidden proxies advanced by that phase
4. Derive 2-5 success criteria per phase (concrete, verifiable results) that respect the decisive outputs, anchors, and forbidden proxies in the approved project contract
5. Validate 100% requirement coverage and surface all contract-critical items
6. Write files immediately (ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability) while preserving any existing `.gpd/state.json` fields, especially `project_contract` and previously recorded open questions
7. Return ROADMAP CREATED with summary

Write files first, then return. This ensures artifacts persist even if context is lost.
</instructions>
", subagent_type="gpd-roadmapper", model="{roadmapper_model}", readonly=false, description="Create research roadmap")
```

**Handle roadmapper return:**

**If the roadmapper agent fails to spawn or returns an error:** Check if ROADMAP.md was partially written (the agent writes files first). If ROADMAP.md exists, verify it has phases and offer to proceed with it. If no ROADMAP.md exists, offer: 1) Retry the roadmapper, 2) Create ROADMAP.md in the main context using PROJECT.md and REQUIREMENTS.md. Do not leave the project in a state with REQUIREMENTS.md but no ROADMAP.md. **Also check if STATE.md exists** — the roadmapper creates both. If STATE.md is missing, create a minimal STATE.md (using the template from Step M5 in the minimal mode section above) so that downstream commands (`convention set`, `state validate`, etc.) can function.

**If `## ROADMAP BLOCKED`:**

- Present blocker information
- Work with user to resolve
- Re-spawn when resolved

**If `## ROADMAP CREATED`:**

Read the created ROADMAP.md and present it nicely inline:

```

```

**If auto mode and `autonomy` is not `supervised`:** Skip approval gate — auto-approve and commit directly.

**CRITICAL: Ask for approval before committing (interactive mode only):**

Use question:

- header: "Roadmap"
- question: "Does this research roadmap structure work for you?"
- options:
  - "Approve" — Commit and continue
  - "Adjust phases" — Tell me what to change
  - "Review full file" — Show raw ROADMAP.md

**If "Approve":** Continue to commit.

**If "Adjust phases":**

- Get user's adjustment notes
- Re-spawn roadmapper with revision context:

  ```
  task(prompt="First, read ./.opencode/agents/gpd-roadmapper.md for your role and instructions.

  <revision>
  User feedback on roadmap:
  [user's notes]

  Read `.gpd/ROADMAP.md` for the current roadmap.

  Update the roadmap based on feedback. Edit files in place.
  Return ROADMAP REVISED with changes made.
  </revision>
  ", subagent_type="gpd-roadmapper", model="{roadmapper_model}", readonly=false, description="Revise roadmap")
  ```

  **If the revision roadmapper agent fails to spawn or returns an error:** Check if ROADMAP.md was updated (compare with pre-revision content). If changes were made, proceed to present the revised roadmap. If no changes, offer: 1) Retry the revision agent, 2) Apply the user's adjustment notes manually in the main context by editing ROADMAP.md directly.

- Present revised roadmap
- Loop until user approves (**maximum 3 revision iterations** — after 3, commit the current version with user's notes recorded as open questions in ROADMAP.md, and note: "Roadmap committed after 3 revision rounds. Further adjustments via `/gpd-add-phase` or `/gpd-remove-phase`.")

**If "Review full file":** Display raw `cat .gpd/ROADMAP.md`, then re-ask.

**Commit roadmap (after approval or auto mode):**

```bash
PRE_CHECK=$(gpd pre-commit-check --files .gpd/ROADMAP.md .gpd/STATE.md .gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>&1) || true
echo "$PRE_CHECK"

gpd commit "docs: create research roadmap ([N] phases)" --files .gpd/ROADMAP.md .gpd/STATE.md .gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

**Checkpoint step 8:**

```bash
cat > .gpd/init-progress.json << CHECKPOINT
{"step": 8, "completed_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)", "description": "ROADMAP.md created and committed"}
CHECKPOINT
```

## 8.5. Establish Conventions

**After roadmap is committed, spawn gpd-notation-coordinator to establish notation conventions.**

This step is critical for multi-phase projects where convention mismatches cause silent errors (wrong signs, factors of 2*pi, metric signature confusion).

**If auto mode:** Auto-approve subfield defaults without user confirmation.

```

>>> Spawning notation coordinator...
```

```bash
NOTATION_MODEL=$(gpd resolve-model gpd-notation-coordinator)
```

Spawn gpd-notation-coordinator:

```
task(prompt="First, read ./.opencode/agents/gpd-notation-coordinator.md for your role and instructions.

<task>
Establish initial conventions for this research project.
</task>

<project_context>
Read these files:
- .gpd/PROJECT.md — Project definition, physics subfield, theoretical framework
- .gpd/ROADMAP.md — Phase structure (what conventions will be needed)
- .gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md — Research requirements
- .gpd/research/SUMMARY.md — Literature survey (if exists)
</project_context>

<mode>
{auto | interactive}

Interactive mode: Present suggested conventions, wait for user confirmation/override.

<output>
1. Create: .gpd/CONVENTIONS.md (full convention reference)
2. Lock conventions via: gpd convention set
3. Return CONVENTIONS ESTABLISHED with summary
</output>
", subagent_type="gpd-notation-coordinator", model="{notation_model}", readonly=false, description="Establish project conventions")
```

**Handle notation-coordinator return:**

**If the notation-coordinator agent fails to spawn or returns an error:** Conventions are not critical for project initialization to succeed, BUT the convention_lock in state.json must be populated for downstream defense layers (L1-L4) to function. Fallback:

1. Create a minimal CONVENTIONS.md with the project's unit system and metric signature from PROJECT.md (if specified)
2. **Populate the convention_lock** with at minimum the unit system and metric signature:

   ```bash
   # Populate convention_lock so downstream L1-L4 defense layers are active
   gpd convention set natural_units "natural" 2>/dev/null || true
   gpd convention set metric_signature "mostly_minus" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

   Adjust values based on what PROJECT.md specifies. If PROJECT.md doesn't specify conventions, use the subfield defaults from `./.opencode/get-physics-done/references/conventions/subfield-convention-defaults.md`.

3. Note that full convention establishment was skipped. The user can run `gpd convention set ...` or `/gpd-validate-conventions` later to complete convention setup.

- **`CONVENTIONS ESTABLISHED`:** Display confirmation with convention summary. Commit CONVENTIONS.md:

  ```bash
  PRE_CHECK=$(gpd pre-commit-check --files .gpd/CONVENTIONS.md 2>&1) || true
  echo "$PRE_CHECK"

  gpd commit "docs: establish notation conventions" --files .gpd/CONVENTIONS.md
  ```

- **`CONVENTION CONFLICT`:** Display conflicts. Ask user to resolve before proceeding.

**Checkpoint step 8.5:**

```bash
cat > .gpd/init-progress.json << CHECKPOINT
{"step": 8.5, "completed_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)", "description": "Conventions established and committed"}
CHECKPOINT
```

## 9. Done

**Delete init-progress.json — initialization is complete:**

```bash
rm -f .gpd/init-progress.json

<!-- [included: questioning.md] -->
<questioning_guide>

Research initialization is problem extraction, not requirements gathering. You're helping the researcher discover and articulate what they want to investigate. This isn't a grant proposal review -- it's collaborative physical thinking.

<philosophy>

**You are a thinking partner, not an interviewer.**

The researcher often has a fuzzy idea -- a physical system, a puzzling observation, a technique they want to apply. Your job is to help them sharpen it. Ask questions that make them think "oh, I hadn't considered that regime" or "yes, that's exactly the observable I care about."

Don't interrogate. Collaborate. Don't follow a script. Follow the physics.

</philosophy>

<the_goal>

By the end of questioning, you need enough clarity to draft a scoping contract and then write a PROJECT.md that downstream phases can act on:

- **Literature review** needs: what field, what's known, what's contested, what references the researcher already has
- **Research plan** needs: clear enough problem statement to scope a tractable investigation
- **Roadmap** needs: clear enough to decompose into phases, what "a result" looks like
- **Scoping contract** needs: decisive outputs, ground-truth anchors, weakest assumptions, and explicit failure signals
- **plan-phase** needs: specific calculations to break into tasks, context for approximation choices
- **execute-phase** needs: success criteria to verify against, the physical motivation behind each computation

A vague PROJECT.md forces every downstream phase to guess. The cost compounds -- wrong approximation schemes, irrelevant limiting cases checked, blind alleys pursued.

</the_goal>

<how_to_question>

**Start open.** Let them dump their physical picture. Don't interrupt with formalism.

**Follow energy.** Whatever they emphasized, dig into that. What observable excited them? What discrepancy sparked this? What experiment are they trying to explain?

**Challenge vagueness.** Never accept fuzzy answers. "Interesting regime" means what parameter values? "Strong interactions" means what coupling? "Good agreement" means what tolerance?

**Make the abstract concrete.** "Walk me through the physical picture." "What would you measure to test this?" "What does the phase diagram look like?"

**Probe assumptions.** "What approximations are you implicitly making?" "Is that valid in this regime?" "What breaks if we relax that assumption?"

**Clarify scope.** "When you say you want to study X, do you mean the equilibrium properties or the dynamics?" "Are you interested in the ground state or finite temperature?"

**Surface anchors early.** Ask what references, prior outputs, benchmarks, datasets, or known results should remain visible if the project goes well. Push until you know the first hard correctness check or smoking-gun signal they would trust; do not settle for loose agreement or generic limiting cases if they expect a sharper benchmark. If none are known yet, record that explicitly instead of inventing one.

**Preserve the user's guidance.** If they name a specific figure, dataset, derivation, notebook, prior run, paper, benchmark, stop condition, or review checkpoint, keep that wording recognizable. Do not flatten it into generic "artifact" or "benchmark" language unless they asked you to broaden it.

**Pressure-test the first story.** Treat the first framing as a working hypothesis, not as truth. Once you have a plausible framing on the table, restate the current picture in one sentence and ask one question that could narrow, overturn, or falsify it.

**Separate decisive outputs from proxies.** Ask what exact output, figure, table, proof obligation, or benchmark would count as success, and what might look like progress but should not count as success.

**Do not force decomposition too early.** If the question, decisive output, and anchors are becoming clear but the roadmap is still fuzzy, record that as an open decomposition question instead of pushing for fake phases.

**Know when to stop.** When you understand what they want to establish, why it matters, what regime or scope they care about, what outputs count as success, and what anchors or disconfirming checks should constrain the work -- offer to proceed.

</how_to_question>

<question_types>

Use these as inspiration, not a checklist. Pick what's relevant to the physics.

**Motivation -- why this problem:**

- "What prompted this investigation?"
- "What experiment or observation are you trying to explain?"
- "What would change in our understanding if you got the answer?"

**Physical picture -- what the system is:**

- "Walk me through the physical setup"
- "You said X -- what does that look like in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom?"
- "Give me the governing model, equations, simulation setup, or core object being studied"
- "What are the relevant energy/length/time scales?"

**Scope and regime -- where you're working:**

- "What parameter regime? Weak coupling, strong coupling, critical?"
- "Zero temperature or finite? Equilibrium or driven?"
- "Continuum or lattice? How many dimensions?"
- "What symmetries does the system have? Which ones matter?"

**Assumptions -- what you're taking for granted:**

- "What approximations are already baked in?"
- "Is mean field sufficient here or do fluctuations matter?"
- "Are you treating this classically or quantum mechanically? Why?"

**Success -- how you'll know it worked:**

- "What does a successful result look like?"
- "What exact output or deliverable would count as done?"
- "What is the first smoking-gun observable, scaling law, curve, or benchmark that would convince you this is genuinely right rather than merely plausible?"
- "What known result should this reduce to in some limit?"
- "Is there experimental data to compare against?"
- "What would make you confident the calculation is correct?"

**Ground-truth anchors -- what reality should constrain this:**

- "Is there a known result, benchmark, prior output, or reference that you would treat as non-negotiable here?"
- "What should a correct result agree with, reduce to, or reproduce?"
- "Are there papers, datasets, or internal artifacts that must stay visible throughout the work?"
- "If the result passed a few limiting cases or sanity checks but missed the smoking-gun check, would you still treat it as wrong?"

**Disconfirmation and failure -- how the current framing could be wrong:**

- "What assumption are we least certain about right now?"
- "What result would make you think this framing is wrong or incomplete?"
- "What would look encouraging but should not count as success?"
- "If your current intuition conflicts with a trusted anchor, which should win?"

</question_types>

<using_askuserquestion>

Use question to help researchers think by presenting concrete physical options to react to.

**Good options:**

- Interpretations of what physical regime they might mean
- Specific approximation schemes to confirm or deny
- Concrete observables that reveal what they care about

**Bad options:**

- Generic categories ("Analytical", "Numerical", "Other")
- Leading options that presume an approach
- Too many options (2-4 is ideal)

**Example -- vague regime:**
Researcher says "the interesting part of the phase diagram"

- header: "Which regime?"
- question: "Interesting how?"
- options: ["Near the critical point", "Deep in the ordered phase", "At the phase boundary", "Let me explain"]

**Example -- following a thread:**
Researcher mentions "anomalous scaling"

- header: "Anomalous scaling"
- question: "What's scaling anomalously?"
- options: ["Correlation length exponent", "Dynamical critical exponent", "Transport coefficient", "Let me explain"]

</using_askuserquestion>

<context_checklist>

Use this as a **background checklist**, not a conversation structure. Check these mentally as you go. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally.

- [ ] What physical system, model, setup, or core object they're studying
- [ ] Why it matters (the physical question or discrepancy driving the investigation)
- [ ] What regime or scope they're in (parameter values, symmetries, approximation validity)
- [ ] What exact output or deliverable would count as success
- [ ] What known result, benchmark, reference, or prior output should anchor the work
- [ ] What assumption is weakest or most uncertain
- [ ] What would falsify or seriously narrow the current framing
- [ ] What would be a misleading proxy for success

These are background checks, not a script. If they volunteer more -- scales, known limits, relevant references, prior outputs, likely failure modes -- capture it.
If they already know only the first grounded investigation chunk, that is enough. Carry the rest as open decomposition rather than forcing a full roadmap during setup.

</context_checklist>

<decision_gate>

Only offer to proceed when you can state, in concrete terms:

- the core problem,
- the decisive output or deliverable,
- at least one anchor (or an explicit "anchor unknown; must establish later"),
- the weakest assumption,
- one failure signal or forbidden proxy,
- and any user-stated prior outputs, stop conditions, or review triggers that must stay visible.

Then offer to proceed:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand the problem, the decisive output, and the anchors we need to respect. Ready to create PROJECT.md?"
- options:
  - "Create PROJECT.md" -- Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" -- I want to clarify more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" -- ask what they want to add or identify gaps in the physical picture and probe naturally.
Lack of a full phase list is not itself a blocker. If only the first grounded investigation chunk is clear, that is enough to offer the gate.

Do not count turns mechanically. Keep exploring while the conversation is materially sharpening the scoping contract, and re-offer the gate when the picture becomes clearer.
Do not offer the gate if you only have proxy checks, sanity checks, or limiting cases with no decisive smoking-gun observable or explicit note that the anchor is still unknown.

</decision_gate>

<anti_patterns>

- **Checklist walking** -- Going through "Hamiltonian? Symmetries? Regime?" regardless of what they said
- **Canned questions** -- "What's your observable?" "What's out of scope?" regardless of context
- **Grant-speak** -- "What are your success metrics?" "Who are the stakeholders?" "What's the broader impact?"
- **Interrogation** -- Firing questions without building on answers or engaging with the physics
- **Rushing** -- Minimizing questions to get to "the calculation"
- **Shallow acceptance** -- Taking "it's in the strong coupling regime" without probing what "strong" means quantitatively
- **Premature formalism** -- Asking about Feynman rules before understanding the physical picture
- **Underestimating the researcher** -- NEVER ask about their physics background or level. They're a physicist. Engage as a peer.

## What This Is

[Current accurate description — 2-3 sentences. What is the physics question being investigated?
What subfield does it belong to? What is the expected deliverable (paper, calculation, simulation)?
Update whenever the research direction drifts from this description.]

## Core Research Question

[The ONE question this project must answer. If everything else fails, this must be resolved.
One sentence that drives prioritization when tradeoffs arise.]

## Scoping Contract Summary

### Contract Coverage

- [Claim / deliverable]: [What counts as success]
- [Acceptance signal]: [Benchmark match, proof obligation, figure, dataset, or review artifact]
- [False progress to reject]: [Proxy that must NOT count as success]

### User Guidance To Preserve

- **User-stated observables:** [Specific quantity, signal, figure, or smoking-gun the user explicitly named]
- **User-stated deliverables:** [Specific table, plot, derivation, dataset, note, or code output the user expects]
- **Must-have references / prior outputs:** [Paper, notebook, baseline run, figure, or benchmark the user said must stay visible]
- **Stop / rethink conditions:** [What should make the system pause, ask again, or re-scope]

### Scope Boundaries

**In scope**

- [What this project explicitly covers]

**Out of scope**

- [What this project explicitly does not cover]

### Active Anchor Registry

- [Anchor ID or short label]: [Paper, dataset, spec, benchmark, or prior artifact]
  - Why it matters: [What claim, observable, or deliverable it constrains]
  - Carry forward: [planning | execution | verification | writing]
  - Required action: [read | use | compare | cite | avoid]

### Carry-Forward Inputs

- [Internal artifact, prior run, notebook, figure, baseline, or "None confirmed yet"]
- [User-asserted anchor or crucial prior output]

### Skeptical Review

- **Weakest anchor:** [Least-certain benchmark, assumption, or prior result]
- **Unvalidated assumptions:** [What is currently assumed rather than checked]
- **Competing explanation:** [Plausible alternative story that could also fit]
- **Disconfirming observation:** [What result would make you stop and rethink]
- **False progress to reject:** [What might look encouraging but should not count as success]

### Open Contract Questions

<guidelines>

**What This Is:**

- Current accurate description of the research project
- 2-3 sentences capturing the physics question and expected deliverable
- Use precise physics language appropriate to the subfield
- Update when the research direction evolves beyond this description

**Core Research Question:**

- The single most important question to answer
- Everything else can fail; this must be resolved
- Drives prioritization when tradeoffs arise (e.g., accuracy vs. generality)
- Rarely changes; if it does, it's a significant pivot in the research program

**Scoping Contract Summary:**

- Short human-readable projection of the authoritative scoping contract
- Capture contract coverage, user guidance, active anchors, carry-forward inputs, skeptical review items, and open contract questions
- Keep this concise and concrete so later workflows can scan it quickly
- If an anchor or prior artifact is unknown, say so explicitly instead of implying certainty
- Preserve the user's wording when they explicitly name an observable, deliverable, prior output, or required reference
- Record user-stated pause / rethink conditions rather than only abstract risks

**Research Questions:**

- Tracks the lifecycle of research questions through three states: Answered, Active, Out of Scope
- `transition.md` moves questions between states after each phase
- `resume-work.md` reads this section for session context
- Active questions guide prioritization; Answered questions record progress

**Research Context:**

- Consolidates physical system, theoretical framework, key parameters, known results, novelty, venue, and computational environment
- Subsumes the roles of standalone Physics Subfield, Mathematical Framework, Computational Tools, and Target Publication sections
- `transition.md` updates Known Results and Key Parameters after analytical/numerical phases
- Key Parameters table should include symbol, regime of validity, and notes

**Requirements:** Tracked in `.gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md` (single source of truth). Do not duplicate requirements content in PROJECT.md.

**Key References:**

- Treat this as a readability mirror of the active anchor registry, not a second source of truth
- Include only references that are already in the structured contract or bibliography flow
- Distinguish must-read anchors from general background when possible
- Update as new relevant literature is discovered

**Notation and Conventions:**

- Populated during project initialization into `.gpd/CONVENTIONS.md` and `.gpd/NOTATION_GLOSSARY.md`
- PROJECT.md contains only a pointer, not inline convention definitions

**Constraints:**

- Hard limits on research choices
- Computational resources, required accuracy, data availability, symmetry requirements
- Include the "why" — constraints without rationale get questioned

**Key Decisions:**

- Inline summary table for quick access; full log in `.gpd/DECISIONS.md`
- `transition.md` adds rows after each phase
- `resume-work.md` reads the table for session context

**Last Updated:**

- Always note when and why the document was updated
- Format: `after Phase 2` or `after validation milestone`
- Triggers review of whether content is still accurate

</guidelines>

<evolution>

PROJECT.md evolves throughout the research lifecycle.

**After each phase transition:**

1. Research Questions: Move answered questions to Answered; add newly emerged questions to Active
2. Requirements invalidated? — Move to Out of Scope with reason
3. Requirements validated? — Move to Validated with phase reference
4. New requirements emerged? — Add to Active
5. Decisions to log? — Add row to Key Decisions table and to `.gpd/DECISIONS.md`
6. Research Context: Update Known Results with new findings; refine Key Parameters if values changed
7. "What This Is" still accurate? — Update if research direction drifted
8. New references discovered? — Add to Key References
9. Revisit the Scoping Contract Summary — weakest anchor, false-progress risks, and open questions still accurate?

**After each milestone:**

1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Research Question check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update notation if conventions were refined
5. Review target publication — still appropriate venue?

</evolution>

<continuation_projects>

For ongoing research projects:

1. **Map existing work first** via `/gpd-map-research`

2. **Infer Validated requirements** from existing calculations:

   - What results have already been derived?
   - What formalisms are established?
   - What numerical results are confirmed?

3. **Gather Active requirements** from researcher:

   - Present inferred current state
   - Ask what they want to calculate/derive next

4. **Initialize:**
   - Validated = confirmed results from existing work
   - Active = researcher's goals for current phase
   - Out of Scope = boundaries researcher specifies
   - Key References = papers already cited in existing drafts

</continuation_projects>

<state_reference>

STATE.md references PROJECT.md:

```markdown
## Project Reference

See: .gpd/PROJECT.md (updated [date])

**Core research question:** [One-liner from Core Research Question section]
**Current focus:** [Current phase name]
```

This ensures the agent reads current PROJECT.md context.

| [Topic] | [Why excluded: e.g., experimental data not yet available for comparison]         |

## Accuracy and Validation Criteria

Standards that results must meet before being considered complete.

| Requirement | Accuracy Target                | Validation Method                           |

| CALC-01     | Phase 3: Calculation | Pending |
| SIMU-01     | Phase 3: Calculation | Pending |
| VALD-01     | Phase 4: Validation  | Pending |
| [REQ-ID]    | Phase [N]            | Pending |

- Mapped to phases: [Y]
- Unmapped: [Z] (warning)

_Requirements defined: [date]_
_Last updated: [date] after [trigger]_
```

</template>

<guidelines>

**Requirement Format:**

- ID: `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (DERV-01, CALC-02, SIMU-03, VALD-01)
- Description: Precise, testable, atomic — a physicist can verify completion
- Checkbox: Only for primary requirements (follow-up requirements are not yet actionable)

**Categories:**

- Derive from the nature of the research project
- Keep consistent with physics domain conventions
- Typical: Derivations, Calculations, Simulations, Validations, Analysis, Comparisons, Paper

**Primary vs Follow-up:**

- Primary: Committed scope, will be in roadmap phases, needed for current paper
- Follow-up: Acknowledged but deferred, not in current roadmap, future paper material
- Moving Follow-up to Primary requires roadmap update

**Out of Scope:**

- Explicit exclusions with reasoning
- Prevents "why didn't you compute X?" later
- Topics outside the energy/length/time scale, beyond current approximation, or requiring unavailable data

**Accuracy and Validation Criteria:**

- Every quantitative result needs a defined accuracy target
- Every result needs a validation method (limiting case, literature comparison, numerical convergence)
- Be specific: "4 significant figures" not "high accuracy"

**Contract Coverage:**

- Every primary requirement should point back to a decisive output or deliverable
- Name the anchor, benchmark, or reference that constrains the requirement
- Carry forward required prior outputs or baselines explicitly when they matter
- Record any misleading proxy that should not be accepted as success

**Traceability:**

- Empty initially, populated during roadmap creation
- Each requirement maps to exactly one phase
- Unmapped requirements = roadmap gap

**Status Values:**

- Pending: Not started
- In Progress: Phase is active
- Complete: Requirement verified against accuracy criteria
- Blocked: Waiting on prerequisite result or external data

</guidelines>

<evolution>

**After each phase completes:**

1. Mark covered requirements as Complete
2. Update traceability status
3. Note any requirements that changed scope or accuracy targets

**After roadmap updates:**

1. Verify all primary requirements still mapped
2. Add new requirements if scope expanded
3. Move requirements to follow-up/out of scope if descoped

**Requirement completion criteria:**

- Requirement is "Complete" when:
  - Derivation/calculation is finished
  - Result meets accuracy criteria
  - Validation method confirms correctness
  - Result is documented with intermediate steps

</evolution>

# Requirements: Topological Phase Transitions in 2D Spin Models

**Defined:** 2026-03-15

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quantum phase transitions | Classical model only; quantum version is separate paper          |
| Dynamics near transition  | Equilibrium properties only; dynamics requires different methods |
| Exact diagonalization     | System sizes too small for meaningful finite-size scaling        |

## Accuracy and Validation Criteria

| SIMU-01     | Statistical error < 0.3% on energy      | Bootstrap with 1000 resamples          |
| SIMU-02     | T_c uncertainty < 1%                    | Finite-size scaling collapse quality   |
| VALD-01     | Match Kosterlitz (1974) T_c to 4 digits | Direct comparison                      |

## Traceability

# state.json Schema

Canonical schema for `.gpd/state.json`. This file is the authoritative machine-readable state. STATE.md is a human-readable view generated from it.

## Top-Level Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose | Authoritative? |
|-------|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| `_version` | `integer` | `1` | Schema version for forward compatibility | Metadata |

| `project_reference` | `object` | see below | Pointer to PROJECT.md with key fields | Derived from PROJECT.md |
| `project_contract` | `ResearchContract \| null` | `null` | Canonical machine-readable scoping and anchor contract | **Authoritative** (JSON-only, stage-0+ contract flow) |
| `position` | `object` | see below | Current phase/plan/status | **Authoritative** (synced to STATE.md) |
| `active_calculations` | `string[]` | `[]` | Work in progress descriptions | STATE.md unless JSON has structured data |
| `intermediate_results` | `ResultObject[] \| string[]` | `[]` | Partial results with equations | **Authoritative** (structured objects from `result add`) |
| `open_questions` | `string[]` | `[]` | Physics questions that emerged | STATE.md unless JSON has structured data |
| `performance_metrics` | `{ rows: MetricRow[] }` | `{ rows: [] }` | Throughput tracking | Synced from STATE.md |
| `decisions` | `DecisionObject[]` | `[]` | Accumulated decisions with rationale | Synced from STATE.md |
| `approximations` | `ApproximationObject[]` | `[]` | Active approximations with validity | **Authoritative** (JSON-only, from `approximation add`) |
| `convention_lock` | `ConventionLock` | see below | Locked physics conventions | **Authoritative** (JSON-only, from `convention set`) |
| `propagated_uncertainties` | `UncertaintyObject[]` | `[]` | Uncertainty propagation tracking | **Authoritative** (JSON-only, from `uncertainty add`) |

| `blockers` | `string[]` | `[]` | Active blockers/concerns | Synced from STATE.md |
| `session` | `SessionObject` | see below | Session continuity for resumption | Synced from STATE.md |

### Authoritative vs Derived

Fields marked **Authoritative** exist only in state.json (not representable in STATE.md markdown). When `sync_state_json()` merges markdown into JSON, it preserves these fields. If state.json is lost, these fields are irrecoverable from STATE.md alone — hence `state.json.bak` exists for crash recovery.

Stored as the canonical machine-readable contract once Stage 1 wiring is complete. Stage 0 freezes the field and model shape so later workflows can write to it safely.

Preferred validation + persistence path for prompt-authored contracts:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$PROJECT_CONTRACT_JSON" | gpd --raw validate project-contract -
printf '%s\n' "$PROJECT_CONTRACT_JSON" | gpd state set-project-contract -
```

The stdin path is canonical because it keeps the exact approved JSON payload in-memory across validation and persistence. Do not tell the model to round-trip through a temporary file unless a human explicitly chose that workflow.

#### Project Contract Object Rules

The `project_contract` value itself must be a JSON object. Do not replace it with prose, a list, or a string.

`schema_version` must be `1`. Unsupported schema versions are invalid.

Approved project contracts must include at least one observable, claim, or deliverable.

`uncertainty_markers.weakest_anchors` and `uncertainty_markers.disconfirming_observations` must both be non-empty.

Canonical IDs and other required string fields are trimmed before validation. Blank-after-trim values are invalid, and duplicates that differ only by surrounding whitespace still collide after normalization.

The following fields always store arrays of objects, never arrays of plain strings:

- `observables[]` — `{ "id", "name", "kind", "definition", "regime?", "units?" }`
- `claims[]` — `{ "id", "statement", "observables[]", "deliverables[]", "acceptance_tests[]", "references[]" }`
- `deliverables[]` — `{ "id", "kind", "path?", "description", "must_contain[]" }`
- `acceptance_tests[]` — `{ "id", "subject", "kind", "procedure", "pass_condition", "evidence_required[]", "automation" }`
- `references[]` — `{ "id", "kind", "locator", "aliases[]", "role", "why_it_matters", "applies_to[]", "carry_forward_to[]", "must_surface", "required_actions[]" }`
- `forbidden_proxies[]` — `{ "id", "subject", "proxy", "reason" }`
- `links[]` — `{ "id", "source", "target", "relation", "verified_by[]" }`

If a project-contract reference sets `must_surface: true`, `required_actions[]` must not be empty.

#### Project Contract ID Linkage Rules

Every ID-like field must point to a declared object ID in the same contract:

- `context_intake.must_read_refs[]` must contain `references[].id` values only.
- `references[].aliases[]` may store stable human-facing labels or citation strings that help canonicalize downstream anchor mentions.
- `claims[].observables[]` must contain `observables[].id` values only.
- `claims[].deliverables[]` must contain `deliverables[].id` values only.
- `claims[].acceptance_tests[]` must contain `acceptance_tests[].id` values only.
- `claims[].references[]` must contain `references[].id` values only.
- `acceptance_tests[].subject` must point to a `claims[].id` or `deliverables[].id`, never an observable ID or prose label.
- `acceptance_tests[].evidence_required[]` may point only to claim, deliverable, acceptance-test, or reference IDs.
- `references[].applies_to[]` must point to a claim ID or deliverable ID.
- `references[].carry_forward_to[]` is free-text workflow scope (for example `planning`, `verification`, `writing`) and must not be overloaded with claim or deliverable IDs.
- `forbidden_proxies[].subject` must point to a claim ID or deliverable ID.
- `links[].source` and `links[].target` may point only to claim, deliverable, acceptance-test, or reference IDs.
- `links[].verified_by[]` must contain `acceptance_tests[].id` values only.

#### Explicit Anchor-Gap Guidance

If the user does not know the decisive anchor yet, keep that uncertainty explicit instead of inventing a paper, reference, benchmark, or baseline. Accepted phrasings include:

- `Which reference should serve as the decisive benchmark anchor?`
- `Benchmark reference not yet selected; still to identify the decisive anchor.`
- `Baseline comparison is TBD before planning can proceed.`

## Validation Rules

Run via `gpd state validate`. Current checks:

1. **state.json exists and parses** — not corrupt JSON
2. **STATE.md exists and parses** — valid markdown structure
3. **Position cross-check** — position fields match between JSON and MD
4. **Convention lock completeness** — reports unset conventions (warning, not error)
5. **No NaN values** — numeric fields (total_phases, total_plans_in_phase, progress_percent) must not be NaN
6. **Schema completeness** — all fields from `default_state_dict()` must be present at top level
7. **Status vocabulary** — status must be from VALID_STATUSES list (12 values)
8. **Phase ID format** — current_phase must match `\d{2}(\.\d+)*` pattern
9. **Phase range** — current_phase must not exceed total_phases when both are set
10. **Result ID uniqueness** — all `intermediate_results[].id` values must be unique
11. **Dependency validity** — `depends_on` references must point to existing result IDs

---

## Dual-Write Protocol

STATE.md and state.json are kept in sync:

1. **STATE.md → state.json**: `sync_state_json()` parses markdown, merges into existing JSON (preserving JSON-only fields)
2. **state.json → STATE.md**: `save_state_json()` calls `generate_state_markdown()` to regenerate markdown
3. **Crash recovery**: `state.json.bak` created after every successful write; `load_state_json()` tries backup before falling back to STATE.md
4. **Atomic writes**: Uses intent-marker protocol (`.state-write-intent`) to detect and recover from interrupted writes
5. **Locking**: `file_lock()` context manager prevents concurrent writes (TOCTOU races)

### Authority hierarchy

```
state.json > STATE.md > state.json.bak > STATE.md (regenerated from defaults)
```

For JSON-only fields (convention_lock, approximations, propagated_uncertainties, structured intermediate_results): state.json is sole authority. STATE.md renders a lossy view (structured objects become flat bullet strings).

For position/decisions/blockers: STATE.md is the primary edit surface; state.json is synced from it.

## Agent Access Patterns

| Agent | Reads | Writes (via gpd CLI) |
|-------|-------|----------------------|
| **gpd-executor** | `convention_lock`, `position`, `intermediate_results` | `state advance-plan`, `state update`, `result add`, `convention set` |
| **gpd-planner** | `convention_lock`, `position`, `decisions`, `blockers` | (reads only — orchestrator writes) |
| **gpd-verifier** | `convention_lock`, `position` | (reads only) |
| **gpd-debugger** | full state | `state add-blocker` |
| **gpd-consistency-checker** | `convention_lock`, `intermediate_results` | (reads only) |
| **gpd-notation-coordinator** | `convention_lock` | `convention set` |
| **gpd-paper-writer** | `convention_lock`, `intermediate_results`, `decisions` | (reads only) |
| **Orchestrators** | `position`, `session` | `state update`, `state patch`, `state advance-plan`, `state record-session`, `state record-metric` |
<!-- [end included] -->

</execution_context>

<process>
**CRITICAL: First, read the full workflow file using the read_file tool:**
Read the file at ./.opencode/get-physics-done/workflows/new-project.md — this contains the complete step-by-step instructions (1693 lines) for initializing a research project. Do NOT improvise. Follow the workflow file exactly.

Also read these reference files:
- ./.opencode/get-physics-done/references/research/questioning.md (questioning protocol)
- ./.opencode/get-physics-done/templates/project.md (PROJECT.md template)
- ./.opencode/get-physics-done/templates/requirements.md (REQUIREMENTS.md template)
- ./.opencode/get-physics-done/templates/state-json-schema.md (project contract object shape and ID linkage rules)

Before synthesizing or revising the raw `project_contract`, use the `project_contract` section of `state-json-schema.md` as the schema source of truth. Do not invent ad-hoc fields, replace object arrays with strings, or create unresolved ID references.

Execute the workflow end-to-end. Preserve all workflow gates (validation, approvals, routing).

## Flag Detection

Check `$ARGUMENTS` for flags:

- **`--auto`** → Auto mode (structured document synthesis + scope approval)
- **`--minimal`** → Minimal mode (fast bootstrapping path with scope approval)
- **`--minimal @file.md`** → Minimal mode with input file

**If `--minimal` detected:** After Setup, route to the **minimal initialization path** in the workflow. This compresses questioning and research, but still requires a scoping contract with decisive outputs, anchors, and explicit approval before downstream artifacts.

**If `--auto` detected:** After Setup, synthesize context from the provided document, repair only blocking gaps, present the scoping contract for approval, then run research → requirements → roadmap automatically with smart defaults.
